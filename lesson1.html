    <p class="lead">Open up some sort of Word Processor (MS Word, Google Docs, whatever.  I don't care) and go ahead and type your name at the top. (Can't be forgetting that now, can we?)</p>
    <p class="lead">There are 3 sections, and 15 total questions, so don't forget to move on to the next section after you finish.  You'll need your headphones for the last section.</p>
    <p class="lead">
      You're going to be using the internet to research several questions, the answers to which you'll type up and then email to me whenever you finish.  Some of the questions will be relatively easy, but some of them might require you to do quite a bit of thinking!  HAVE FUN.
