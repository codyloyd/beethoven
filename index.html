        <h3>It's fairly well known that Beethoven slowly lost his hearing, going completely deaf by the time of his death.  <br>
        Even though he couldn't hear any of the music he composed in his later years, he didn't stop composing until the very end. <br>
        In this assignment we are going to explore whether or not Beethoven's deafness had an impact on the music he composed, or his historical legacy.</h3>
